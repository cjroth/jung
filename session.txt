two possibilities:

1. user has session
  -> session maps to a user account
      -> user is logged in
  -> session does not map to a user account
2. user does not have session
  -> create a new session

  if user logs in after already having a different session, merge session data with user account
  if user creates an account after already having session data, merge session data with new user account
